# SmileDetector-python
This code uses open-cv lib and haarcascade to detect the face and detect the smile within the face area. If the person is smiling in the webcam, a test of "smiling" will show up underneath the face area. At the end, the video of the webcam will be recorded and saved into a .avi video file.
